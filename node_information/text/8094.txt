Libra may be losing support from key partners already

   Recent reports say Facebook's Libra may be late, with some key backers

   Facebook's cryptocurrency Libra is looking less likely to launch as
   originally envisioned by the day.

   A new report from the Wall Street Journal claims that key partners,
   including Visa and Mastercard, are having second thoughts about their
   involvement in Libra.

   These and other partners have initially signed up to be part of the
   Libra Association, a Swiss-based organization that's supposed to govern
   Libra. But after intense scrutiny from lawmakers in the U.S. and
   Europe, some of these partners are reportedly unhappy with Facebook's
   answers on how Libra will handle illegal activities, including money
   laundering and financing of terror groups, on the platform.

   Also notable is the lack of public support from Facebook's Libra
   partners. In July, Mashable has asked six of them, including Visa and
   Mastercard, whether they still support Libra, and received no answers.
   And I've seen no public statements of support from them since, leaving
   Facebook to defend the project on its own.

   So far, this has mostly been left to Head of Calibra (which is a wallet
   for Libra) David Marcus — and sure enough, he commented on WSJ's story
   on Twitter shortly after it was published.

     Felt like addressing this. 1) official 1st wave of Libra Association
     members will be formalized in the weeks to come; (continued)

   According to Marcus, the official "1st wave of Libra Association
   members will be formalized in the weeks to come." It's unclear whether
   this means all 22 partners that were listed at Libra's launch in June,
   and Marcus said in the same Twitter thread that he has "no knowledge of
   specific organizations [sic] plans to not step up."

   Marcus did say that the notion that Facebook did not share "detailed
   information about how to secure Libra and protect the network against
   illegal activity is categorically untrue."

   "We're very calmly, and confidently working through the legitimate
   concerns that Libra has raised by bringing conversations about the
   value of digital currencies to the forefront," he tweeted.

   Should Libra lose support from Visa and Mastercard, it would be a major
   blow to the nascent cryptocurrency and payment platform. According to
   the Journal, representatives from the companies backing Libra are
   scheduled to meet on Oct. 14 in Geneva to review the association's
   charter and appoint a board of directors.

   The WSJ's report follows a recent report by Reuters quoting Bertrand
   Perez, the managing director of Libra Association, as saying that Libra
   may not launch in June 2020 as originally envisioned, but perhaps one
   or two quarters later.

   In possibly the most relatable verses since Lizzo asked why men great
   'til they gotta be great, Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda appeared
   on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon to freestyle about hating
   open-plan offices and other everyday pet peeves.

   "Still hungover from my day on Sunday / Karen comes over, 'Looks like a
   case of the Mondays!'" spits Miranda. "Go away, Karen!"

   Miranda was joined by the rest of his hip-hop improv group Freestyle
   Love Supreme: Anthony Veneziale, Utkarsh Ambudkar, Aneesa Folds, Chris
   Sullivan, Arthur Lewis and Bill Sherman. Though love is literally in
   their name, the group stuck to rapping about topics the audience hated,
   including college debt and Tinder dates with nasty bunions — and was
   rewarded with a standing ovation.
