   We loved the location, outside to the Klaster-garden. The menu was not

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Well it is a restaurant, so yes, when you know you want to go to a
   certain restaurant you should always make a reservation. Even if they
   are not fully booked for that time, it is good for every restaurant to
   know what amount of people they should count with for certain time.
   Making a reservation takes about the same time as posting a question

   Grill itself yourself is fun and tasty in Prague

   This restaurant presents many options. You can grill beef, chicken,
   fish or calamari at your table or allow the kitchen staff to do it for
   you. It was simple and fun - much like a Korean Barbeque in the US. The
   sauces were excellent -...More

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   From memory, the ticket counter in the foyer appeared to be well
   stocked but since we're heathens, I didn't take a lot of interest in
   buying any souvenirs However, we were struck by how accessible the
   paintings and artefacts were in the Museum e.g you were allowed to get
   up close and personal to many 700 years old paintings and wooden
   effigies with no restrictions other than an attendant standing at the
   end of the room with his only warning being 'No fllash photography' So
   perhaps you could take many natural light photos for souvenirs (e.g. I
   took several photos of the boards describing the history of ST. Agnes)

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Hell! Please, help me with some information: as a group, we can visit
   the Jewish quarter without a ticket, just walking through, but, if we
   want to go inside the buildings we will pay for e ticket, if necessary?

   An interesting building but the tour was very limited

   We took the guided tour, which is the only way to view the Baroque
   Library Hall, Meridian Hall and the Astronomical Tower, a tiny portion
   of this vast complex which is now part of the Prague University. It was

   Worst tour!!

   understand the reasoning but for the price, we should have been told

   Overrated and Overpriced

   Yes, the library is fascinating, but you can’t go in or take any photos
   after waiting 90 minutes and climbing a lot of stairs. The 2 Baroque
   libraries at Strahov Monastery are just as fascinating, cheaper and
   faster to get into, far less stairs and...More

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Great entrees and main courses

   We loved the location, outside to the Klaster-garden. The menu was not

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Grill itself yourself is fun and tasty in Prague

   This restaurant presents many options. You can grill beef, chicken,
   fish or calamari at your table or allow the kitchen staff to do it for
   you. It was simple and fun - much like a Korean Barbeque in the US. The

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   From memory, the ticket counter in the foyer appeared to be well
   stocked but since we're heathens, I didn't take a lot of interest in
   buying any souvenirs However, we were struck by how accessible the
   paintings and artefacts were in the Museum e.g you were allowed to get
   up close and personal to many 700 years old paintings and wooden
   effigies with no restrictions other than an attendant standing at the
   end of the room with his only warning being 'No fllash photography' So
   perhaps you could take many natural light photos for souvenirs (e.g. I
   took several photos of the boards describing the history of ST. Agnes)

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Hell! Please, help me with some information: as a group, we can visit
   the Jewish quarter without a ticket, just walking through, but, if we
   want to go inside the buildings we will pay for e ticket, if necessary?

   History & Beauty! But may not be for everyone!

   History and beauty! A wonderful place for a history/science geek like

   An interesting building but the tour was very limited

   We took the guided tour, which is the only way to view the Baroque
   Library Hall, Meridian Hall and the Astronomical Tower, a tiny portion
   of this vast complex which is now part of the Prague University. It was
   pricey at CZK 300 per adult...More

   Worst tour!!

   Overpriced and you only get to stand in the doorway of the library. I
   understand the reasoning but for the price, we should have been told
   what we would see. However you do get to go to the tower and see great
   views of the...More

   Overrated and Overpriced

   Yes, the library is fascinating, but you can’t go in or take any photos
   after waiting 90 minutes and climbing a lot of stairs. The 2 Baroque
   libraries at Strahov Monastery are just as fascinating, cheaper and
   faster to get into, far less stairs and...More

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.
