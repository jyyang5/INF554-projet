       delivered in an effective, secure and consistent manner;
     * (b) Recognise when a visitor to an Hyve Group Plc website has
       visited before; this means we can identify the number of unique
       visitors we receive to the website and allows us to make sure we
       have enough capacity for the number of users that we get;
     * (c) Customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of
       the pages of the website;
     * (d) Store your product selections to the shopping basket;
     * (e) Improve the website(s) and learn which parts are most popular
       to visitors. To do this, we gather statistical information about
       how our visitors use the website(s) including device-specific data
       such as the IP address of the device (collected and stored in an
       anonymised format); the device screen size; the device type and
       browser information; country of location; and the preferred
       language used to display the website(s). Our servers also
       automatically record information including the referring domain;
       the pages visited; and the date and time when website(s) pages were
       accessed;
     * (f) Gather information through our advertising partners, about the
       pages on the Hyve Group Plc website(s) that you visit, and also
       other information about other websites that you visit, so as to
       place you in an “interest segment”. This information is then used
       to serve interest-based advertisements which it is believed will be
       targeted to your interests. For more information about this type of
       interest based advertising, and about how to turn this feature off
       please visit www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/ or follow the link to

The Top Ten Challenges Facing Education Right Now

   [__700x9999.Top-Ten-Challenges-Facing-Education.png]

   Education in the modern world is in an interesting place. On one hand,
   more children, teenagers, and adults are receiving a quality education
   in the United Kingdom than ever before; on the other, government policy
   shifts, worldwide EdTech trends, and a variety of other factors mean
   there remains many education challenges to overcome.

   The issues facing educators vary between sectors. The priorities of a
   lecturer at a higher learning institute will differ from those of
   primary school teachers, will differ from a secondary school teacher’s.

   So where does Education Technology (EdTech) fit into all this?
   Humankind has been using technology to its advantage for millennia, and
   teaching and learning has been no exception. EdTech has been a great
   boon for education establishments at all levels.

   With that in mind, this whitepaper focuses on the big challenges
   currently facing educators in the UK – and how EdTech can help to
   overcome them.

   Before we begin however, please bear in mind that educators and
   students are at the heart of education. Technology is not the be all
   and end all. It can help users achieve great things, but its
   effectiveness is reliant on how teachers, students, and education
   leaders interact with it.

Academic Mentoring with Learning Analytics

   [__700x9999.Bett_Day2_2019_116.jpg]

   I have been very fortunate to work at The Springfield Anglican College
   for the past 11 years, as a teacher and e-learning leader.  The College
   itself is only 21 years old and during the last 6 years I have been
   excited about working on a project focused on improving the academic
   success of our senior students using a learning analytic platform.  We
   started our journey with the objective of making academic rigour and
   success habitual for and an expectation of our graduating cohorts.

   Students and parents were given access to a dashboard that allowed them
   to see academic progress across time and look closely at areas of
   strength and those for development.  The dashboard provides real time
   assessment tracking and subject criteria reporting.  In addition,
   students were allocated an Academic Mentor from the teaching staff who
   sat with each student and helped them to set goals and identify trends
   in their own learning.

   The process of introducing the platform to students and parents
   involved education for all stakeholders about the comparison to cohort,
   identification of process goals and outcome goals, and development of
   our mentoring teachers working collaboratively with students.

   The key indicator for engagement from students was the long and short
   term goals that were self established within the platform.  The
   platform developer, Trackone Studios, provided the College the
   opportunity for a flexible space to develop and we listened to students
   about the aspects of the platform from which they were benefitting, and
   learned that that drop-down boxes and staff writing on the behalf of
   students reduced student ownership dramatically.  By listening to
   students, we also learned that when the choice of Academic Mentor was
   available to students the experience and outcomes improved.

   Like any school case study there are many variables that are to be
   considered in the success of any project.  We have fantastic teaching
   at the College, a range of pathways for learners and students that
   continue to flourish, however in 2017 we finished on top of the highest
   achieving secondary schools table for Queensland.  Something of which
   the students should be proud, and something that suggests giving
   students access to live data that shows progress across learning
   supports success.

   Our students are the best advocates, please take the time to share
   their experiences with this short video:

The Top Ten Challenges Facing Education Right Now

   [__700x9999.Top-Ten-Challenges-Facing-Education.png]

   Education in the modern world is in an interesting place. On one hand,
   more children, teenagers, and adults are receiving a quality education
   in the United Kingdom than ever before; on the other, government policy
   shifts, worldwide EdTech trends, and a variety of other factors mean
   there remains many education challenges to overcome.

   The issues facing educators vary between sectors. The priorities of a
   lecturer at a higher learning institute will differ from those of
   primary school teachers, will differ from a secondary school teacher’s.

   So where does Education Technology (EdTech) fit into all this?
   Humankind has been using technology to its advantage for millennia, and
   teaching and learning has been no exception. EdTech has been a great
   boon for education establishments at all levels.

   With that in mind, this whitepaper focuses on the big challenges
   currently facing educators in the UK – and how EdTech can help to
   overcome them.

   Before we begin however, please bear in mind that educators and
   students are at the heart of education. Technology is not the be all

Academic Mentoring with Learning Analytics

   [__700x9999.Bett_Day2_2019_116.jpg]

   I have been very fortunate to work at The Springfield Anglican College
   for the past 11 years, as a teacher and e-learning leader.  The College
   itself is only 21 years old and during the last 6 years I have been
   excited about working on a project focused on improving the academic
   success of our senior students using a learning analytic platform.  We
   started our journey with the objective of making academic rigour and
   success habitual for and an expectation of our graduating cohorts.

   Students and parents were given access to a dashboard that allowed them
   to see academic progress across time and look closely at areas of
   strength and those for development.  The dashboard provides real time
   assessment tracking and subject criteria reporting.  In addition,
   students were allocated an Academic Mentor from the teaching staff who
   sat with each student and helped them to set goals and identify trends
   in their own learning.

   The process of introducing the platform to students and parents
   involved education for all stakeholders about the comparison to cohort,
   identification of process goals and outcome goals, and development of
   our mentoring teachers working collaboratively with students.

   The key indicator for engagement from students was the long and short
   term goals that were self established within the platform.  The
   platform developer, Trackone Studios, provided the College the
   opportunity for a flexible space to develop and we listened to students
   about the aspects of the platform from which they were benefitting, and
   learned that that drop-down boxes and staff writing on the behalf of
   students reduced student ownership dramatically.  By listening to
   students, we also learned that when the choice of Academic Mentor was
   available to students the experience and outcomes improved.

   Like any school case study there are many variables that are to be
   considered in the success of any project.  We have fantastic teaching
   at the College, a range of pathways for learners and students that
   continue to flourish, however in 2017 we finished on top of the highest
   achieving secondary schools table for Queensland.  Something of which
   the students should be proud, and something that suggests giving
   students access to live data that shows progress across learning
   supports success.

   Our students are the best advocates, please take the time to share
   their experiences with this short video:
