   wasn't directly linked to Crouch the way any random object he handed
   him could have been and he rigged parts of the Tournament to ensure
   Harry was the first one to touch the cup. In addition, if Harry
   disappeared in the middle of a dangerous task, it would take longer to
   notice than if he had disappeared in the middle of a normal school day.
   (For all the teachers knew, he could have been hiding in a bush or
   under an enchantment.) Plus, this way Harry was already exhausted and
   injured when he arrived in the graveyard (although whether Voldemort
   intended this or not is unknown). It's also possible that Voldemort was
   trying to be extra evil by killing Harry just when he was feeling
   triumphant about winning the Triwizard Tournament.(less) (hide

   Weer eens fantasties. Dis nou minstens die sesde keer dat ek die boek
   in Engels lees (daar was ook al seker vier of vyf keer in Afrikaans) en
   die kompleksiteit en vaardigheid van Rowling se skryfwerk vang my elke
   keer. Dit is waarlik 'n kroonjuweel in die Engelse
   kinderliteratuurskat!

   Although she writes under the pen name J.K. Rowling, pronounced like
   rolling, her name when her first Harry Potter book was published was
   simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target audience of young
   boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers
   demanded that she use two initials, rather than her full name. As she
   had no middle name, she chose K as the second initial of her pen name,
   from her paternal grandmother Kathleen Ada Bulgen Rowling. She calls
   herself Jo and has said, "No one ever called me 'Joanne' when I was
   young, unless they were angry." Following her marriage, she has
   sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal
   business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name
   of Joanne Kathleen Rowling. In a 2012 interview, Rowling noted that she
   no longer cared that people pronounced her name incorrectly.
   Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce aircraft
   engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), on 31 July 1965 in Yate,
   Gloucestershire, England, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Bristol. Her
   mother Anne was half-French and half-Scottish. Her parents first met on
   a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964.
   They married on 14 March 1965. Her mother's maternal grandfather,
   Dugald Campbell, was born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's
   paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was awarded the Croix de Guerre for
   exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte
   during the First World War.
   Rowling's sister Dianne was born at their home when Rowling was 23
   months old. The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when
   Rowling was four. She attended St Michael's Primary School, a school
   founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer
   Hannah More. Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been
   suggested as the inspiration for the Harry Potter headmaster Albus
   Dumbledore.
   As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would
   usually then read to her sister. She recalls that: "I can still
   remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole
   and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. Certainly the
   first story I ever wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a
   rabbit called Rabbit. He got the measles and was visited by his
   friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee." At the age of nine,
   Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of
   Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. When she was a young teenager, her
   great aunt, who Rowling said "taught classics and approved of a thirst
   for knowledge, even of a questionable kind," gave her a very old copy
   of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, Hons and Rebels. Mitford became
   Rowling's heroine, and Rowling subsequently read all of her books.
   Rowling has said of her teenage years, in an interview with The New
   Yorker, "I wasn’t particularly happy. I think it’s a dreadful time of
   life." She had a difficult homelife; her mother was ill and she had a
   difficult relationship with her father (she is no longer on speaking
   terms with him). She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and
   College, where her mother had worked as a technician in the science
   department. Rowling said of her adolescence, "Hermione [a bookish,
   know-it-all Harry Potter character] is loosely based on me. She's a
   caricature of me when I was eleven, which I'm not particularly proud
   of." Steve Eddy, who taught Rowling English when she first arrived,
   remembers her as "not exceptional" but "one of a group of girls who
   were bright, and quite good at English." Sean Harris, her best friend
   in the Upper Sixth owned a turquoise Ford Anglia, which she says
   inspired the one in her books. ...more

   He wants to find out about the mysterious event that's supposed to take

   He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. But unfortunately

   wasn't directly linked to Crouch the way any random object he handed
   him could have been and he rigged parts of the Tournament to ensure
   Harry was the first one to touch the cup. In addition, if Harry
   disappeared in the middle of a dangerous task, it would take longer to
   notice than if he had disappeared in the middle of a normal school day.
   (For all the teachers knew, he could have been hiding in a bush or
   under an enchantment.) Plus, this way Harry was already exhausted and
   injured when he arrived in the graveyard (although whether Voldemort
   intended this or not is unknown). It's also possible that Voldemort was
   trying to be extra evil by killing Harry just when he was feeling
   triumphant about winning the Triwizard Tournament.(less) (hide

   Un tēmas, kas bija universāli svarīgas pirms desmit gadiem, tagad kļūst
   jo sevišķi aktuālas. Roulinga iekodē dzīves patiesības bērnu grāmatās
   ar apskaužamu efektivitāti.
   "Es jums visiem vēlreiz lieku pie sirds, ka, ņemot vērā lorda
   Voldemorta atgriešanos, mūsu spēks ir tikai vienotībā un vājums -
   savstarpējā naidā. Lords Voldemorts lieliski prot sēt naidu un
   neuzticēšanos. Tam pretim mēs varam likt tikai vienlīdz stipru
   draudzību un uzticēšanos. Ieražu un valodu atšķirības nav nekas, ja
   vien mums ir viens mērķis un mūsu sirdis paliek atvērtas. Es paredzu -
   un nekad vēl neesmu tik ļoti vēlējies aloties -, ka mums priekšā ir
   tumši un grūti laiki. [..] Var pienākt laiks, kad jums vajadzēs
   izšķirties starp to, kas ir pareizi, un to, kā ir vieglāk."
   Tagad priekšā smagākais posms. Rūpīgi plānoju laiku pa stundām, vēl
   daudz lapaspušu priekšā, bet esmu jau iegājusi kādā īpašā prāta
   stāvoklī, kad neko citu tāpat nespētu padarīt.

   Noliekot grāmatu, parastā pasaule - mājas, virtuve, dators - šķiet
   tik.. out of place and mundane. Roulinga spēj visu attēlot tik dzīvi,
   ka tu pat nepamani, ka esi ievilkts viņas pasaulē.
   Tikai tagad atjēdzos, cik maz manā atmiņā ir palicis no visa, kas
   noticis pēc ceturtās grāmatas vidus. Zinot, ka pēdējās daļas es atceros
   vēl mazāk, I'm in for an amazing ride.

   noslēpumainajā burvju skolā Cūkārpā.„ Harijs Poters un Uguns biķeris”
   ir fantastikas un piedzīvojumu grāmatu sērijas 4. daļa, kurā grāmatas
   galvenajam varonim ir jāpiedalās interesantās un prātam neaptveramās
   spēlēs.
   Šajā grāmatā notikumi risinās lēnām un sazaroti – katra nodaļa pavēstī
   kādu jaunu notikumu vai negaidītu pavērsienu. Daudzi grāmatas tēli ir
   ļoti noslēpumaini, neizdibināmi. Kā, piemēram, Bosbatonas skolas
   direktors, kurš visas grāmatas garumā Harija draugiem likās aizdomīgs,
   un ar slēptu vēlmi nodarīt maģiskajam puisēnam pāri. Tomēr vēlāk
   atklājās, ka tieši Karkarovs, Durmštrangas skolas direktors, cilvēks,
   kurš bija šķitis neitrāls visā šajā notikumu virknē, izrādījās sens
   Lorda Voldemorda sekotājs. Šādas tēlu izspēles nepārtraukti mijas
   grāmatā, kas man šķiet ir ļoti piemērotas fantastikas un piedzīvojumu
   grāmatām.
   Autores izvēlētā valoda grāmatā ir viegli uztverama un saprotama, tieši
   tādēļ šo grāmatu var lasīt jebkurā vecumā.
   Šo grāmatu bija interesanti lasīt, un noteikti ieteiktu izlasīt arī
   saviem draugiem, kuri ir aizrāvušies ar piedzīvojumiem, kā arī tiem ,
   kuri vēlas nedaudz atpūsties lasot. Secinu, ka no grāmatas neko daudz
   nevar mācīties, taču tā ir aizraujoša, un notikumiem pilna.

   Fantastiski! Cik savādi ir ielūkoties Harija Potera pasaulē, ar mazliet
   pieaugušāku aci un ieraudzīt Roulingas atklāsmes par dzīvi, spēku,
   grūtībām. 4. daļa bija gara, jā, bet tik aizraujoša, ka uzreiz stiepjas
   roka pēc Fēniksa ordeņa!
   Harija Potera maratonu novadīšu līdz galam! Redzēs, kā ies!

   Although she writes under the pen name J.K. Rowling, pronounced like
   rolling, her name when her first Harry Potter book was published was
   simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target audience of young
   boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers
   demanded that she use two initials, rather than her full name. As she
   had no middle name, she chose K as the second initial of her pen name,
   from her paternal grandmother Kathleen Ada Bulgen Rowling. She calls
   herself Jo and has said, "No one ever called me 'Joanne' when I was
   young, unless they were angry." Following her marriage, she has
   sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal
   business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name
   of Joanne Kathleen Rowling. In a 2012 interview, Rowling noted that she
   no longer cared that people pronounced her name incorrectly.
   Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce aircraft
   engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), on 31 July 1965 in Yate,
   Gloucestershire, England, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Bristol. Her
   mother Anne was half-French and half-Scottish. Her parents first met on
   a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964.
   They married on 14 March 1965. Her mother's maternal grandfather,
   Dugald Campbell, was born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's
   paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was awarded the Croix de Guerre for
   exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte
   during the First World War.
   Rowling's sister Dianne was born at their home when Rowling was 23
   months old. The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when
   Rowling was four. She attended St Michael's Primary School, a school
   founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer
   Hannah More. Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been
   suggested as the inspiration for the Harry Potter headmaster Albus
   Dumbledore.
   As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would
   usually then read to her sister. She recalls that: "I can still
   remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole
   and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. Certainly the
   first story I ever wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a
   rabbit called Rabbit. He got the measles and was visited by his
   friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee." At the age of nine,
   Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of
   Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. When she was a young teenager, her
   great aunt, who Rowling said "taught classics and approved of a thirst
   for knowledge, even of a questionable kind," gave her a very old copy
   of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, Hons and Rebels. Mitford became
   Rowling's heroine, and Rowling subsequently read all of her books.
   Rowling has said of her teenage years, in an interview with The New
   Yorker, "I wasn’t particularly happy. I think it’s a dreadful time of
   life." She had a difficult homelife; her mother was ill and she had a
   difficult relationship with her father (she is no longer on speaking
   terms with him). She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and
   College, where her mother had worked as a technician in the science
   department. Rowling said of her adolescence, "Hermione [a bookish,
   know-it-all Harry Potter character] is loosely based on me. She's a
   caricature of me when I was eleven, which I'm not particularly proud
   of." Steve Eddy, who taught Rowling English when she first arrived,
   remembers her as "not exceptional" but "one of a group of girls who
   were bright, and quite good at English." Sean Harris, her best friend
   in the Upper Sixth owned a turquoise Ford Anglia, which she says
   inspired the one in her books. ...more

   wasn't directly linked to Crouch the way any random object he handed
   him could have been and he rigged parts of the Tournament to ensure
   Harry was the first one to touch the cup. In addition, if Harry
   disappeared in the middle of a dangerous task, it would take longer to
   notice than if he had disappeared in the middle of a normal school day.
   (For all the teachers knew, he could have been hiding in a bush or
   under an enchantment.) Plus, this way Harry was already exhausted and
   injured when he arrived in the graveyard (although whether Voldemort
   intended this or not is unknown). It's also possible that Voldemort was
   trying to be extra evil by killing Harry just when he was feeling
   triumphant about winning the Triwizard Tournament.(less) (hide

   Although she writes under the pen name J.K. Rowling, pronounced like
   rolling, her name when her first Harry Potter book was published was
   simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target audience of young
   boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers
   demanded that she use two initials, rather than her full name. As she
   had no middle name, she chose K as the second initial of her pen name,
   from her paternal grandmother Kathleen Ada Bulgen Rowling. She calls
   herself Jo and has said, "No one ever called me 'Joanne' when I was
   young, unless they were angry." Following her marriage, she has
   sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal
   business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name
   of Joanne Kathleen Rowling. In a 2012 interview, Rowling noted that she
   no longer cared that people pronounced her name incorrectly.
   Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce aircraft
   engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), on 31 July 1965 in Yate,
   Gloucestershire, England, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Bristol. Her
   mother Anne was half-French and half-Scottish. Her parents first met on
   a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964.
   They married on 14 March 1965. Her mother's maternal grandfather,
   Dugald Campbell, was born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's
   paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was awarded the Croix de Guerre for
   exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte
   during the First World War.
   Rowling's sister Dianne was born at their home when Rowling was 23
   months old. The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when
   Rowling was four. She attended St Michael's Primary School, a school
   founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer
   Hannah More. Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been
   suggested as the inspiration for the Harry Potter headmaster Albus
   Dumbledore.
   As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would
   usually then read to her sister. She recalls that: "I can still
   remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole
   and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. Certainly the
   first story I ever wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a
   rabbit called Rabbit. He got the measles and was visited by his
   friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee." At the age of nine,
   Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of
   Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. When she was a young teenager, her
   great aunt, who Rowling said "taught classics and approved of a thirst
   for knowledge, even of a questionable kind," gave her a very old copy
   of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, Hons and Rebels. Mitford became
   Rowling's heroine, and Rowling subsequently read all of her books.
   Rowling has said of her teenage years, in an interview with The New
   Yorker, "I wasn’t particularly happy. I think it’s a dreadful time of
   life." She had a difficult homelife; her mother was ill and she had a
   difficult relationship with her father (she is no longer on speaking
   terms with him). She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and
   College, where her mother had worked as a technician in the science
   department. Rowling said of her adolescence, "Hermione [a bookish,
   know-it-all Harry Potter character] is loosely based on me. She's a
   caricature of me when I was eleven, which I'm not particularly proud
   of." Steve Eddy, who taught Rowling English when she first arrived,
   remembers her as "not exceptional" but "one of a group of girls who
   were bright, and quite good at English." Sean Harris, her best friend
   in the Upper Sixth owned a turquoise Ford Anglia, which she says
   inspired the one in her books. ...more

   wasn't directly linked to Crouch the way any random object he handed
   him could have been and he rigged parts of the Tournament to ensure
   Harry was the first one to touch the cup. In addition, if Harry
   disappeared in the middle of a dangerous task, it would take longer to
   notice than if he had disappeared in the middle of a normal school day.
   (For all the teachers knew, he could have been hiding in a bush or
   under an enchantment.) Plus, this way Harry was already exhausted and
   injured when he arrived in the graveyard (although whether Voldemort
   intended this or not is unknown). It's also possible that Voldemort was
   trying to be extra evil by killing Harry just when he was feeling
   triumphant about winning the Triwizard Tournament.(less) (hide

   Z Ognjenim kelihom serija HP začne odraščati, posledično se to dogaja
   tudi s karakterji. Tu Hermiona najbolj izstopa, saj jo ta knjiga
   prikaže kot zelo močno osebo, ki se postavi zase in za to, v kar
   verjame, a vendar ostane tudi zelo solidarna. Vidimo lahko, da je
   prijateljica, ki bi si jo vsak želel. Všeč mi je, da je v knjigi precej
   realno prikazano, da punce odrastejo hitreje kot fantje, vsaj v smislu
   čustvene inteligence, in je to tudi vzrok konfliktom. Ron je pa na
   trenutke pravi kreten :) Z Ognjenim kelihom serija HP začne odraščati,

   Zanimivo in zelo kompleksno dogajanje okoli Trišolskega turnirja in še
   en odlično predstavljen zlikovec, Barty Hulesh mlajši. Kar se tiče
   prvih dveh nalog na turnirju, pa si ne moreš kaj, da ti ne bi šla na
   živce Harryjeva nesposobnost - vedno se zakoplje v neke povsem
   irelevantne knjige in mu mora nekdo drug rešiti rit. Oh saj vem, takega
   ga imamo radi, pa vseeno.
   Saj res, Rita je izvrstna. Eden boljših karakterjev, ki jih sicer
   sovražiš. Seveda pa z njo obračuna Hermiona in še enkrat pokaže, da se
   z njo ni za šalit.
   Cedric ni ravno toliko prisoten, da bi ga človek pošteno vzljubil,
   čeprav ima nekaj svetlih trenutkov, predvsem v kontrastu s svojim
   grozno zoprnim fotrom. Seveda pa sta na sredini labirinta oba s
   Harryjem grozno plemenita. Njegova smrt ne prizadene toliko sama po
   sebi, temveč bolj zaradi reakcij - predvsem Dumbledorjevega govora in
   pozneje Hagridove opazke, da "Kar mora priti, pride in ko bo prišlo, se
   bo treba postaviti po robu." Tu dobimo nek vpogled v dosti temačnejšo
   prihodnost zadnjih treh knjig in dokaz, da je serija dokončno odrasla.

   Although she writes under the pen name J.K. Rowling, pronounced like
   rolling, her name when her first Harry Potter book was published was
   simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target audience of young
   boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers
   demanded that she use two initials, rather than her full name. As she
   had no middle name, she chose K as the second initial of her pen name,
   from her paternal grandmother Kathleen Ada Bulgen Rowling. She calls
   herself Jo and has said, "No one ever called me 'Joanne' when I was
   young, unless they were angry." Following her marriage, she has
   sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal
   business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name
   of Joanne Kathleen Rowling. In a 2012 interview, Rowling noted that she
   no longer cared that people pronounced her name incorrectly.
   Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce aircraft
   engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), on 31 July 1965 in Yate,
   Gloucestershire, England, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Bristol. Her
   mother Anne was half-French and half-Scottish. Her parents first met on
   a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964.
   They married on 14 March 1965. Her mother's maternal grandfather,
   Dugald Campbell, was born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's
   paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was awarded the Croix de Guerre for
   exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte
   during the First World War.
   Rowling's sister Dianne was born at their home when Rowling was 23
   months old. The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when
   Rowling was four. She attended St Michael's Primary School, a school
   founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer
   Hannah More. Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been
   suggested as the inspiration for the Harry Potter headmaster Albus
   Dumbledore.
   As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would
   usually then read to her sister. She recalls that: "I can still
   remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole
   and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. Certainly the
   first story I ever wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a
   rabbit called Rabbit. He got the measles and was visited by his
   friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee." At the age of nine,
   Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of
   Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. When she was a young teenager, her
   great aunt, who Rowling said "taught classics and approved of a thirst
   for knowledge, even of a questionable kind," gave her a very old copy
   of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, Hons and Rebels. Mitford became
   Rowling's heroine, and Rowling subsequently read all of her books.
   Rowling has said of her teenage years, in an interview with The New
   Yorker, "I wasn’t particularly happy. I think it’s a dreadful time of
   life." She had a difficult homelife; her mother was ill and she had a
   difficult relationship with her father (she is no longer on speaking
   terms with him). She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and
   College, where her mother had worked as a technician in the science
   department. Rowling said of her adolescence, "Hermione [a bookish,
   know-it-all Harry Potter character] is loosely based on me. She's a
   caricature of me when I was eleven, which I'm not particularly proud
   of." Steve Eddy, who taught Rowling English when she first arrived,
   remembers her as "not exceptional" but "one of a group of girls who
   were bright, and quite good at English." Sean Harris, her best friend
   in the Upper Sixth owned a turquoise Ford Anglia, which she says
   inspired the one in her books. ...more

   wasn't directly linked to Crouch the way any random object he handed
   him could have been and he rigged parts of the Tournament to ensure
   Harry was the first one to touch the cup. In addition, if Harry
   disappeared in the middle of a dangerous task, it would take longer to
   notice than if he had disappeared in the middle of a normal school day.
   (For all the teachers knew, he could have been hiding in a bush or
   under an enchantment.) Plus, this way Harry was already exhausted and
   injured when he arrived in the graveyard (although whether Voldemort
   intended this or not is unknown). It's also possible that Voldemort was
   trying to be extra evil by killing Harry just when he was feeling
   triumphant about winning the Triwizard Tournament.(less) (hide

   Ово није само још једна фантастична књига о Харију Потеру, већ и прича
   која ће ми заувек остати у сећању. Поред тога што сам се неконтролисано
   смејала, плакала, згрожавала, што ми је срце поскакивало од адрелина,
   научила сам доста ствари. Не само како бих могла да изведем болну
   клетву над људима који ме иритирају, већ како су поштење, част,
   храброст, истина, пријатељство и породица изнад свега. Што се тога
   конкретно тиче, Албус Дамблдор је један од најмудријих фиктивних јунака

   Што се тога конкретно тиче, Албус Дамблдор је један од најмудријих
   фиктивних јунака са којим сам се икада сусрела, на којег ћу се врло
   радо угледати.

   Драго ми је што сам рођена у време кад су књиге тек излазиле и што сам
   имала прилику да испуним детињство најлепшим причама, што за многу
   садашњу и будућу децу више, нажалост, није тако. У међувремену,
   подигнимо наше штапиће у част Седрика Дигорија. Био је добар момак.

   Although she writes under the pen name J.K. Rowling, pronounced like
   rolling, her name when her first Harry Potter book was published was
   simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target audience of young
   boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers
   demanded that she use two initials, rather than her full name. As she
   had no middle name, she chose K as the second initial of her pen name,
   from her paternal grandmother Kathleen Ada Bulgen Rowling. She calls
   herself Jo and has said, "No one ever called me 'Joanne' when I was
   young, unless they were angry." Following her marriage, she has
   sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal
   business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name
   of Joanne Kathleen Rowling. In a 2012 interview, Rowling noted that she
   no longer cared that people pronounced her name incorrectly.
   Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce aircraft
   engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), on 31 July 1965 in Yate,
   Gloucestershire, England, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Bristol. Her
   mother Anne was half-French and half-Scottish. Her parents first met on
   a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964.
   They married on 14 March 1965. Her mother's maternal grandfather,
   Dugald Campbell, was born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's
   paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was awarded the Croix de Guerre for
   exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte
   during the First World War.
   Rowling's sister Dianne was born at their home when Rowling was 23
   months old. The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when
   Rowling was four. She attended St Michael's Primary School, a school
   founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer
   Hannah More. Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been
   suggested as the inspiration for the Harry Potter headmaster Albus
   Dumbledore.
   As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would
   usually then read to her sister. She recalls that: "I can still
   remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole
   and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. Certainly the
   first story I ever wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a
   rabbit called Rabbit. He got the measles and was visited by his
   friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee." At the age of nine,
   Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of
   Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. When she was a young teenager, her
   great aunt, who Rowling said "taught classics and approved of a thirst
   for knowledge, even of a questionable kind," gave her a very old copy
   of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, Hons and Rebels. Mitford became
   Rowling's heroine, and Rowling subsequently read all of her books.
   Rowling has said of her teenage years, in an interview with The New
   Yorker, "I wasn’t particularly happy. I think it’s a dreadful time of
   life." She had a difficult homelife; her mother was ill and she had a
   difficult relationship with her father (she is no longer on speaking
   terms with him). She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and
   College, where her mother had worked as a technician in the science
   department. Rowling said of her adolescence, "Hermione [a bookish,
   know-it-all Harry Potter character] is loosely based on me. She's a
   caricature of me when I was eleven, which I'm not particularly proud
   of." Steve Eddy, who taught Rowling English when she first arrived,
   remembers her as "not exceptional" but "one of a group of girls who
   were bright, and quite good at English." Sean Harris, her best friend
   in the Upper Sixth owned a turquoise Ford Anglia, which she says
   inspired the one in her books. ...more
