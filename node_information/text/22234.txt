Q&A on the Book Continuous Delivery in Java
       The book Continuous Delivery in Java by Daniel Bryant and Abraham
       Marin-Perez was released nearly ten years after the original
       Continuous Delivery book by Dave Farley and Jez Humble, and more
       than 20 years after Java‚Äôs first release. Q&A with the authors to
       better understand from their experience why a book on Continuous
       Delivery specifically for Java and the JVM ecosystem was needed.

DDD & Microservices -> Do neg√≥cio √† arquitetura
       O DDD √© um conjunto de princ√≠pios de constru√ß√£o de software baseado
       no profundo entendimento do neg√≥cio. Naturalmente, uma das √°reas
       impactadas por esses princ√≠pios √© a arquitetura. Em se tratando de
       Microsservi√ßos, √© ainda mais importante que a constru√ß√£o e
       organiza√ß√£o dos servi√ßos esteja alinhada com o neg√≥cio, para que se
       tenha o maior ganho de performance e efici√™ncia na manuten√ß√£o.

Sendo um engenheiro de software √©tico
       Nossa vida tem melhorado por conta da tecnologia. A engenharia de
       software √© umas das pr√°ticas mais influenciadoras que temos nos
       dias atuais e que est√° moldando a sociedade que conhecemos, mas ao
       que parece a ind√∫stria ainda n√£o compartilha dessa responsabilidade
       social. No fim das contas, n√£o se trata de sermos melhores
       desenvolvedores, mas sim de sermos pessoas melhores.

Desenvolvimento orientado pela observabilidade
       Como o desenvolvimento orientado por observabilidade difere do
       monitoramento? √Ä medida que os sistemas distribu√≠dos se tornam cada
       vez mais complicados e os silos se degradam para testes, automa√ß√£o
       e efici√™ncia de DevOps, a ODD surge como um superconjunto de
       monitoramento para compreender as inc√≥gnitas desconhecidas do seu
       c√≥digo.

Q&A on the Book Continuous Delivery in Java
       The book Continuous Delivery in Java by Daniel Bryant and Abraham
       Marin-Perez was released nearly ten years after the original

       better understand from their experience why a book on Continuous
       Delivery specifically for Java and the JVM ecosystem was needed.

Construindo um pipeline CI/CD + Liquibase no GitLab
       Neste artigo veremos como construir um pipeline CI/CD utilizando o
       GitLab-CI para realizar a parte de compila√ß√£o, testes unit√°rios,
       empacotamento e deploy de uma aplica√ß√£o Java utilizando Maven no
       servidor de aplica√ß√£o WildFly. Por fim, o gerenciamento de mudan√ßa
       do banco de dados atrav√©s da ferramenta Liquibase ser√° autom√°tico.

DDD & Microservices -> Do neg√≥cio √† arquitetura
       O DDD √© um conjunto de princ√≠pios de constru√ß√£o de software baseado
       no profundo entendimento do neg√≥cio. Naturalmente, uma das √°reas
       impactadas por esses princ√≠pios √© a arquitetura. Em se tratando de
       Microsservi√ßos, √© ainda mais importante que a constru√ß√£o e
       organiza√ß√£o dos servi√ßos esteja alinhada com o neg√≥cio, para que se
       tenha o maior ganho de performance e efici√™ncia na manuten√ß√£o.

Sendo um engenheiro de software √©tico
       Nossa vida tem melhorado por conta da tecnologia. A engenharia de
       software √© umas das pr√°ticas mais influenciadoras que temos nos
       dias atuais e que est√° moldando a sociedade que conhecemos, mas ao
       que parece a ind√∫stria ainda n√£o compartilha dessa responsabilidade
       social. No fim das contas, n√£o se trata de sermos melhores
       desenvolvedores, mas sim de sermos pessoas melhores.

Desenvolvimento orientado pela observabilidade
       Como o desenvolvimento orientado por observabilidade difere do
       monitoramento? √Ä medida que os sistemas distribu√≠dos se tornam cada
       vez mais complicados e os silos se degradam para testes, automa√ß√£o
       e efici√™ncia de DevOps, a ODD surge como um superconjunto de
       monitoramento para compreender as inc√≥gnitas desconhecidas do seu
       c√≥digo.

   1% para um Mundo Melhor

   N√≥s nos preocupamos com o mundo em que n√≥s vivemos e gostar√≠amos de
   fazer dele um lugar melhor.

   Uma das formas de fazermos isso √© colocando em pr√°tica nossa miss√£o de
   potencializar o lado humano do desenvolvimento de software.

   N√≥s tamb√©m doamos 1% do nosso lucro para diferentes causas, que n√≥s
   como empresa, e tamb√©m como colaboradores, acreditamos.
