The wifey has been wanting a Alexa or smart speaker for an anniversary gift…
well today while at a Goodwill I happened across a iLive Performance
Concierge speaker, basically a Alexa smart enabled speaker, for $3.00!! Works
perfect and we had a cord that works with it for charging. She loves it and
has been playing trivia and word games with it all evening! I love being able
to get her something she wants and even more so when it’s a awesome bargain
price!
