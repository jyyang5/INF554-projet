   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"Enjoying this moment with my family is unique"

   Milan’s Teatro alla Scala acclaimed #TheBest, joined by the great and
   good of the beautiful ga,e. Lionel Messi collected the Best FIFA Men’s
   Player award for the first time, though it is the sixth time that he
   has been recognised by world football’s governing body as the player of
   the year.

   After beating fellow finalists Cristiano Ronaldo and Virgil van Dijk to
   the award, the 32-year-old Argentinian star shared his views of the
   evening with FIFA and looked back on his award-winning season.

   He reflects on a "strange" season, helping through the next generation
   of Barcelona starlets and gives an insight into the rivalry with
   Cristiano Ronaldo.

   It’s been four years since we’ve won the Champions League and we really

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"I never want to put a limit on myself"

   Megan Rapinoe is The Best FIFA Women's Player 2019. The 34-year-old saw
   off USA team-mate Alex Morgan and England star Lucy Bronze to claim the
   highest individual prize in women's football.

   The award caps a remarkable year both personally - she claimed the
   adidas Golden Boot and Golden Ball at the FIFA Women's World Cup France
   2019™ - and with the USA who won the France 2019 title in
   July. FIFA.com caught up with Rapinoe moments after she received her
   trophy on stage at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan.

   She opened up on her acceptance speech, the highs of France 2019 and
   how it differed from her first Women's World Cup win four years
   earlier.

   Usain Bolt of Soccer Aid World XI
   Usain Bolt of Soccer Aid World XI
   BOLT

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"As a Manchester United fan, I would probably vote for Ronaldo!"

   Usain Bolt knows a thing or two about being #TheBest. The Jamaican is
   the only athlete in history to win three Olympic golds in one track
   event – and he did it in both the 100 and 200 metres. ‘Lightning Bolt’
   boasts eight Olympic golds overall, as well as 11 IAAF World
   Championships and three still-standing global records.

   FIFA.com caught up with the 33-year-old to discuss whether Cristiano
   Ronaldo, Lionel Messi or Virgil van Dijk should be crowned at The Best
   FIFA Football Awards™ on Monday, as well as Kylian Mbappe, Neymar, Paul
   Pogba, Raheem Sterling and his recently-relinquished attempt at a
   career as a striker.

   Usain Bolt during a Central Coast Mariners training session

   I hear a lot of people have this debate but both Messi and Ronaldo are
   footballing geniuses. I have always been a big Ronaldo fan and I admire
   the way he has been successful in different leagues – England, Spain
   and now Italy.

   MESSI

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"Enjoying this moment with my family is unique"

   Milan’s Teatro alla Scala acclaimed #TheBest, joined by the great and
   good of the beautiful ga,e. Lionel Messi collected the Best FIFA Men’s
   Player award for the first time, though it is the sixth time that he
   has been recognised by world football’s governing body as the player of
   the year.

   After beating fellow finalists Cristiano Ronaldo and Virgil van Dijk to
   the award, the 32-year-old Argentinian star shared his views of the
   evening with FIFA and looked back on his award-winning season.

   He reflects on a "strange" season, helping through the next generation
   of Barcelona starlets and gives an insight into the rivalry with
   Cristiano Ronaldo.

   It’s been four years since we’ve won the Champions League and we really

   in day out, then we won’t make it.

   RAPINOE

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"I never want to put a limit on myself"

   Megan Rapinoe is The Best FIFA Women's Player 2019. The 34-year-old saw
   off USA team-mate Alex Morgan and England star Lucy Bronze to claim the
   highest individual prize in women's football.

   The award caps a remarkable year both personally - she claimed the
   adidas Golden Boot and Golden Ball at the FIFA Women's World Cup France
   2019™ - and with the USA who won the France 2019 title in
   July. FIFA.com caught up with Rapinoe moments after she received her
   trophy on stage at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan.

   She opened up on her acceptance speech, the highs of France 2019 and
   how it differed from her first Women's World Cup win four years
   earlier.

   BOLT

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"As a Manchester United fan, I would probably vote for Ronaldo!"

   Usain Bolt knows a thing or two about being #TheBest. The Jamaican is
   the only athlete in history to win three Olympic golds in one track
   event – and he did it in both the 100 and 200 metres. ‘Lightning Bolt’
   boasts eight Olympic golds overall, as well as 11 IAAF World
   Championships and three still-standing global records.

   FIFA.com caught up with the 33-year-old to discuss whether Cristiano
   Ronaldo, Lionel Messi or Virgil van Dijk should be crowned at The Best
   FIFA Football Awards™ on Monday, as well as Kylian Mbappe, Neymar, Paul
   Pogba, Raheem Sterling and his recently-relinquished attempt at a
   career as a striker.

   Usain Bolt during a Central Coast Mariners training session

   I hear a lot of people have this debate but both Messi and Ronaldo are
   footballing geniuses. I have always been a big Ronaldo fan and I admire
   the way he has been successful in different leagues – England, Spain
   and now Italy.

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

Klopp: I am who I am because of my players

   25 Sep 2019

   Jurgen Klopp was struggling to contain his emotions. Just a few moments
   earlier, the Liverpool coach had put the icing on his spectacular 2019
   with The Best FIFA Men’s Coach Award and the smile from his face showed
   his immense pride. For the German coach, emotions and analysis have
   always gone hand in hand, and in that expansive mood he spoke to
   FIFA.com in detail about his amazing year.

FIFA.com: How do you feel after being named The Best FIFA Men's Coach of
2019?

   Jurgen Klopp: I didn’t expect to feel so good, but I’m really happy to
   be here and really proud to have won this award. It’s a great day for
   me.

You said before you preferred team rather than individual recognition, in
that sense, do you share this award with your players?

   Of course, absolutely. In terms of football, I am who I am because of
   my players but, as a person, I am who I am because of my family, and I
   am very grateful to them as well. They are everything to me.

You had to beat two excellent coaches to be The Best, what do you think of
them?

   I respect them a lot. What [Mauricio] Pochettino did last year was so
   exceptional. Many times when you don’t win a title, people don’t
   remember you but he was extremely impressive. He has built his team
   step by step, keeping the team together. Pep Guardiola… what can I say?
   He has won so many titles, the way his teams play. He’s so exceptional;
   hands down, the best manager I’ve coached against. It was an honour to
   be nominated alongside them.

Three Premier League coaches, does this mark a trend for football in the
coming years?

   Well, I wouldn’t go that far. The Premier League has a big influence
   from different managers. It’s not reflected in the results every time
   because that’d be impossible but, in the long term, we have been
   influential. I don’t think it’s a trend because football always changes
   but there are so many good teams in the Premier League fighting for
   something. It’s not that we have made Spain or Germany smaller, it’s
   that the competition can be of six or seven teams and that makes it
   really special. And those teams obviously have great managers.

What was your favourite moment of 2019?

   The victory against Barcelona. It was the outstanding moment for sure.
   A lot of experts, myself probably included, wouldn’t have bet money on
   us. Because being 3-0 down against a team with [Lionel] Messi, [Luis]
   Suarez and all those players looks like a death sentence. We didn’t
   believe we’d win, we just knew we had a chance, and we believed in that
   chance. It was massive. The support we had in the stadium. Looking back
   we could say we won the Champions League in that game. All of us will
   remember it forever.

What did you tell the players before that match?

   A lot of things, but the key words were at the end. I said. “I normally
   wouldn’t think it’s possible, but because it’s you, we have a chance”.
   That was exactly what I thought and what I felt. And from the first
   minute we were literally all over Barcelona. And at that moment, I
   thought “we are ready at least”, and it’s very difficult to cope with a
   team like us and the atmosphere in the stadium in moments like this.

There’s an anecdote that says that, the day after you won the Bundesliga with
Dortmund, you woke up in the parade bus all alone. Did something similar
happen this time?

   That anecdote is true! It was after the parade. But that morning when I
   woke up and I didn’t really know what had happened, I decided something
   like that would never happen again. I’m a control freak so I don’t like
   to be drunk. This time I was completely sober so I remember every
   second of the parade. I think I’d be able to recognise people in the
   city that I saw from that bus if I see them again. It was that intense,
   just incredible.

     * Ellis: "Being the coach of this team has been a tremendous
       privilege"

   Though it was the second time that she took home FIFA's top prize for
   women's coaches, Jill Ellis was still emotional after hearing the
   ovation at the Teatro alla Scala Monday night.

   “Oh, it is heavy”, the USA head coach said, firmly grasping the trophy
   in her hands.

   Ellis spoke to FIFA.com about her back-to-back FIFA Women's World Cup™
   titles and now having two coaching awards in tow.

FIFA.com: Jill, how do you feel after being named The Best FIFA Women's
Coach?

   Jill Ellis: It is incredible; very special and truly an honour. I am
   blessed to have it. I represent so many other people. Winning this
   award twice it is incredible. Without the players and all the staff you
   don’t achieve these things – it is truly a team award. My players, they
   had an amazing summer. I owe so much to them.

Winning a FIFA Women's World Cup is amazing. Winning two in a row is
historic.

   It was incredibly special. And both of them were very different. I had
   a lot longer build-up for the one in 2019; the one in 2015 was a
   shorter time. Both were very, very special. I think this recent one was
   hard, just because of all the teams we had to fight to win. A lot of
   really talented teams. But I had a great team and a lot of supporters
   with us. It just made the journey incredibly special.

Can you pick out a favourite moment from your time in France?

   A lot of really cool moments. I think the evening at the Parc des
   Princes playing France was unlike any match I've ever been involved in:
   the atmosphere, the stage, playing against the home team, playing such
   a phenomenal opponent that performed so well. That was a memory that
   really stuck out.

   I think that Alyssa Naeher's penalty save [in the semi-final against
   England] was one of those moments, too. With the level of competition,
   you just knew that it would be hard for us to be successful. Sharing
   those moments with our fans and my family, with the players and the
   staff, and actually lifting the trophy was pretty remarkable.

Your run as USA coach will be over soon. What are your emotions nearing the
end?

   It feels gratifying. It was the right decision. It was an amazing
   journey with a fantastic group of players. But it feels right – I'm
   ready to go on and face a different challenge. Being the coach of this
   team has been a tremendous privilege. But I am ready now to try and do
   something different.

It sounds like retirement isn't in your plans just yet.

   I feel that I'm too young to retire. I love the game, so I would love
   to be connected to the game in some way. What that will be, I don’t
   know yet. I haven’t really thought it through. I have two more games,
   and then I will pause and see what happens. Soccer is such a great part
   of my life; I cannot image not staying connected to it.

Do you feel like you're leaving any unfinished business?

   No, I feel that this journey is more than just matches and medals and
   trophies. It is really about moments. And I think that along this
   journey there have been highs and there's most definitely been lows. I
   think that the tough times and the great times are all part of it, and
   I embrace it all. There is nothing that I feel I left undone. The
   journey is what it is, and it has been a great ride.

     This is how Jill Ellis voted 🗳️

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"Enjoying this moment with my family is unique"

   Milan’s Teatro alla Scala acclaimed #TheBest, joined by the great and
   good of the beautiful ga,e. Lionel Messi collected the Best FIFA Men’s
   Player award for the first time, though it is the sixth time that he
   has been recognised by world football’s governing body as the player of
   the year.

   After beating fellow finalists Cristiano Ronaldo and Virgil van Dijk to
   the award, the 32-year-old Argentinian star shared his views of the
   evening with FIFA and looked back on his award-winning season.

   He reflects on a "strange" season, helping through the next generation
   of Barcelona starlets and gives an insight into the rivalry with
   Cristiano Ronaldo.

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"I never want to put a limit on myself"

   Megan Rapinoe is The Best FIFA Women's Player 2019. The 34-year-old saw
   off USA team-mate Alex Morgan and England star Lucy Bronze to claim the
   highest individual prize in women's football.

   The award caps a remarkable year both personally - she claimed the
   adidas Golden Boot and Golden Ball at the FIFA Women's World Cup France
   2019™ - and with the USA who won the France 2019 title in
   July. FIFA.com caught up with Rapinoe moments after she received her
   trophy on stage at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan.

   She opened up on her acceptance speech, the highs of France 2019 and
   how it differed from her first Women's World Cup win four years
   earlier.

   Usain Bolt of Soccer Aid World XI
   Usain Bolt of Soccer Aid World XI
   BOLT

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"As a Manchester United fan, I would probably vote for Ronaldo!"

   Usain Bolt knows a thing or two about being #TheBest. The Jamaican is
   the only athlete in history to win three Olympic golds in one track
   event – and he did it in both the 100 and 200 metres. ‘Lightning Bolt’
   boasts eight Olympic golds overall, as well as 11 IAAF World
   Championships and three still-standing global records.

   FIFA.com caught up with the 33-year-old to discuss whether Cristiano
   Ronaldo, Lionel Messi or Virgil van Dijk should be crowned at The Best
   FIFA Football Awards™ on Monday, as well as Kylian Mbappe, Neymar, Paul
   Pogba, Raheem Sterling and his recently-relinquished attempt at a
   career as a striker.

   Usain Bolt during a Central Coast Mariners training session

   I hear a lot of people have this debate but both Messi and Ronaldo are
   footballing geniuses. I have always been a big Ronaldo fan and I admire
   the way he has been successful in different leagues – England, Spain
   and now Italy.

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"Enjoying this moment with my family is unique"

   Milan’s Teatro alla Scala acclaimed #TheBest, joined by the great and
   good of the beautiful ga,e. Lionel Messi collected the Best FIFA Men’s
   Player award for the first time, though it is the sixth time that he
   has been recognised by world football’s governing body as the player of
   the year.

   After beating fellow finalists Cristiano Ronaldo and Virgil van Dijk to
   the award, the 32-year-old Argentinian star shared his views of the
   evening with FIFA and looked back on his award-winning season.

   He reflects on a "strange" season, helping through the next generation
   of Barcelona starlets and gives an insight into the rivalry with
   Cristiano Ronaldo.

   It’s been four years since we’ve won the Champions League and we really

   RAPINOE

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"I never want to put a limit on myself"

   Megan Rapinoe is The Best FIFA Women's Player 2019. The 34-year-old saw
   off USA team-mate Alex Morgan and England star Lucy Bronze to claim the
   highest individual prize in women's football.

   The award caps a remarkable year both personally - she claimed the
   adidas Golden Boot and Golden Ball at the FIFA Women's World Cup France
   2019™ - and with the USA who won the France 2019 title in
   July. FIFA.com caught up with Rapinoe moments after she received her
   trophy on stage at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan.

   She opened up on her acceptance speech, the highs of France 2019 and
   how it differed from her first Women's World Cup win four years
   earlier.

   BOLT

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

"As a Manchester United fan, I would probably vote for Ronaldo!"

   Usain Bolt knows a thing or two about being #TheBest. The Jamaican is
   the only athlete in history to win three Olympic golds in one track
   event – and he did it in both the 100 and 200 metres. ‘Lightning Bolt’
   boasts eight Olympic golds overall, as well as 11 IAAF World
   Championships and three still-standing global records.

   FIFA.com caught up with the 33-year-old to discuss whether Cristiano
   Ronaldo, Lionel Messi or Virgil van Dijk should be crowned at The Best
   FIFA Football Awards™ on Monday, as well as Kylian Mbappe, Neymar, Paul
   Pogba, Raheem Sterling and his recently-relinquished attempt at a
   career as a striker.

   Usain Bolt during a Central Coast Mariners training session

   I hear a lot of people have this debate but both Messi and Ronaldo are
   footballing geniuses. I have always been a big Ronaldo fan and I admire
   the way he has been successful in different leagues – England, Spain
   and now Italy.

   The Best FIFA Football Awards

Klopp: I am who I am because of my players

   25 Sep 2019

   Jurgen Klopp was struggling to contain his emotions. Just a few moments
   earlier, the Liverpool coach had put the icing on his spectacular 2019
   with The Best FIFA Men’s Coach Award and the smile from his face showed
   his immense pride. For the German coach, emotions and analysis have
   always gone hand in hand, and in that expansive mood he spoke to
   FIFA.com in detail about his amazing year.

FIFA.com: How do you feel after being named The Best FIFA Men's Coach of
2019?

   Jurgen Klopp: I didn’t expect to feel so good, but I’m really happy to
   be here and really proud to have won this award. It’s a great day for
   me.

You said before you preferred team rather than individual recognition, in
that sense, do you share this award with your players?

   Of course, absolutely. In terms of football, I am who I am because of
   my players but, as a person, I am who I am because of my family, and I
   am very grateful to them as well. They are everything to me.

You had to beat two excellent coaches to be The Best, what do you think of
them?

   I respect them a lot. What [Mauricio] Pochettino did last year was so
   exceptional. Many times when you don’t win a title, people don’t
   remember you but he was extremely impressive. He has built his team
   step by step, keeping the team together. Pep Guardiola… what can I say?
   He has won so many titles, the way his teams play. He’s so exceptional;
   hands down, the best manager I’ve coached against. It was an honour to
   be nominated alongside them.

Three Premier League coaches, does this mark a trend for football in the
coming years?

   Well, I wouldn’t go that far. The Premier League has a big influence
   from different managers. It’s not reflected in the results every time
   because that’d be impossible but, in the long term, we have been
   influential. I don’t think it’s a trend because football always changes
   but there are so many good teams in the Premier League fighting for
   something. It’s not that we have made Spain or Germany smaller, it’s
   that the competition can be of six or seven teams and that makes it
   really special. And those teams obviously have great managers.

What was your favourite moment of 2019?

   The victory against Barcelona. It was the outstanding moment for sure.
   A lot of experts, myself probably included, wouldn’t have bet money on
   us. Because being 3-0 down against a team with [Lionel] Messi, [Luis]
   Suarez and all those players looks like a death sentence. We didn’t
   believe we’d win, we just knew we had a chance, and we believed in that
   chance. It was massive. The support we had in the stadium. Looking back
   we could say we won the Champions League in that game. All of us will
   remember it forever.

What did you tell the players before that match?

   A lot of things, but the key words were at the end. I said. “I normally
   wouldn’t think it’s possible, but because it’s you, we have a chance”.
   That was exactly what I thought and what I felt. And from the first
   minute we were literally all over Barcelona. And at that moment, I
   thought “we are ready at least”, and it’s very difficult to cope with a
   team like us and the atmosphere in the stadium in moments like this.

There’s an anecdote that says that, the day after you won the Bundesliga with
Dortmund, you woke up in the parade bus all alone. Did something similar
happen this time?

   That anecdote is true! It was after the parade. But that morning when I
   woke up and I didn’t really know what had happened, I decided something
   like that would never happen again. I’m a control freak so I don’t like
   to be drunk. This time I was completely sober so I remember every
   second of the parade. I think I’d be able to recognise people in the
   city that I saw from that bus if I see them again. It was that intense,
   just incredible.

     * Ellis: "Being the coach of this team has been a tremendous
       privilege"

   Though it was the second time that she took home FIFA's top prize for
   women's coaches, Jill Ellis was still emotional after hearing the
   ovation at the Teatro alla Scala Monday night.

   “Oh, it is heavy”, the USA head coach said, firmly grasping the trophy
   in her hands.

   Ellis spoke to FIFA.com about her back-to-back FIFA Women's World Cup™
   titles and now having two coaching awards in tow.

FIFA.com: Jill, how do you feel after being named The Best FIFA Women's
Coach?

   Jill Ellis: It is incredible; very special and truly an honour. I am
   blessed to have it. I represent so many other people. Winning this
   award twice it is incredible. Without the players and all the staff you
   don’t achieve these things – it is truly a team award. My players, they
   had an amazing summer. I owe so much to them.

Winning a FIFA Women's World Cup is amazing. Winning two in a row is
historic.

   It was incredibly special. And both of them were very different. I had
   a lot longer build-up for the one in 2019; the one in 2015 was a
   shorter time. Both were very, very special. I think this recent one was
   hard, just because of all the teams we had to fight to win. A lot of
   really talented teams. But I had a great team and a lot of supporters
   with us. It just made the journey incredibly special.

Can you pick out a favourite moment from your time in France?

   A lot of really cool moments. I think the evening at the Parc des
   Princes playing France was unlike any match I've ever been involved in:
   the atmosphere, the stage, playing against the home team, playing such
   a phenomenal opponent that performed so well. That was a memory that
   really stuck out.

   I think that Alyssa Naeher's penalty save [in the semi-final against
   England] was one of those moments, too. With the level of competition,
   you just knew that it would be hard for us to be successful. Sharing
   those moments with our fans and my family, with the players and the
   staff, and actually lifting the trophy was pretty remarkable.

Your run as USA coach will be over soon. What are your emotions nearing the
end?

   It feels gratifying. It was the right decision. It was an amazing
   journey with a fantastic group of players. But it feels right – I'm
   ready to go on and face a different challenge. Being the coach of this
   team has been a tremendous privilege. But I am ready now to try and do
   something different.

It sounds like retirement isn't in your plans just yet.

   I feel that I'm too young to retire. I love the game, so I would love
   to be connected to the game in some way. What that will be, I don’t
   know yet. I haven’t really thought it through. I have two more games,
   and then I will pause and see what happens. Soccer is such a great part
   of my life; I cannot image not staying connected to it.

Do you feel like you're leaving any unfinished business?

   No, I feel that this journey is more than just matches and medals and
   trophies. It is really about moments. And I think that along this
   journey there have been highs and there's most definitely been lows. I
   think that the tough times and the great times are all part of it, and
   I embrace it all. There is nothing that I feel I left undone. The
   journey is what it is, and it has been a great ride.

     This is how Jill Ellis voted 🗳️
